# time-series-analysis

This project analyzes the RON/EUR exchange rate using univariate and multivariate time series methods. It covers trend and seasonality analysis, smoothing techniques (SES, Holt), ARIMA, ETS, and GARCH modeling, residual diagnostics, and stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS, Phillips-Perron). The multivariate analysis includes VAR and VECM models, Granger causality, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to modeling, forecasting, and evaluating currency exchange rates using statistical and econometric methods.
